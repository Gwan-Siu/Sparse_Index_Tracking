# Sparse_Index_Tracking

Financial index tracking is a passive strategy in asset investment. Instead of dense asset allocation, sparse index tracking have several advantages, e.g., small transaction costs. Here, four sparse index tracking methods are impletemented, which are

- LASSO Regression
- Weighted LASSO Regression
- Least regression with MC penalty [1]
- LAIT [2]

The results of different methods are shown as below:
